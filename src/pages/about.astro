      <p class="about-text">
        Linux Directory exists to help developers, system administrators, and Linux enthusiasts discover the best open-source tools and software. We believe in the power of community-driven curation to surface high-quality tools that might otherwise go unnoticed.

      <h2 class="about-section-title">Why We Built This</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        The Linux ecosystem is incredibly rich, but finding the right tools can be overwhelming. We created this directory to provide a curated, community-driven resource where you can:

      <ul class="about-list">
        <li class="about-list-item">Discover tools organized by category and use case</li>
        <li class="about-list-item">Find detailed descriptions and links to official resources</li>
        <li class="about-list-item">See pricing models and licensing information</li>
        <li class="about-list-item">Submit your own favorite tools to help others</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="about-section-title">Community-Driven</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        Every tool in our directory is submitted and reviewed by the community. We believe the best recommendations come from real users who have experience with these tools in production environments.
